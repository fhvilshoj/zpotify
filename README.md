# This is a simple tool for controlling Spotify from the commandline.

`TODO`:

1. Describe install with anaconda and/or `venv` with use of the `zpotify` script
2. Describe setting up symlink
3. Describe usage and need of "Active device"
4. Describe setting up Developer Account on Spotify to get and score `client_id` and `client_secret`.
	Maybe everybody can just use my client? Not sure how people usually do this?

```bash
> zpotify play
> zpotify pause
```
